## Hello WAB (Web App Background)

An implementation of [the WAB architecture](https://youtu.be/LJtyFKhVNiQ) using [Daily video APIs](https://www.daily.co)

Share an app token using the top left menu, and the web app starts running as a background in all the clients connected to the video session.

This makes it really easy to share local devices, or other collaboration apps, within a Zoom-like meeting.
